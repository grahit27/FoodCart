# Cloning Swiggy's Website using React.js, Tailwind CSS and Redux
This project aims to build a website as close as one by Swiggy. </br>
Here are some key learnings while making this project:
* Implementing both Functional and Class-based components along with React Life Cycle. 
* Solving Rendering issues using useEffect Hooks. 
* Created Shimmer UI whenever data gets delayed or becomes unavailable to make UX better.
* React creates a SPA (Single Page Application ie. all components are loaded together).
* Used Lazy-Loading/Dynamic Import technique to reduce its loading time.
* Understanding the basics of Redux Store and how it manages the states in it.
